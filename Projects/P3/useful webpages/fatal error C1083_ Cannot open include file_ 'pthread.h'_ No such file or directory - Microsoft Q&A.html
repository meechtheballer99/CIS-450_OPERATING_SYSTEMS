               <p>Hello Dileep, </p> 
               <p>How do you add the pthread plugin to VS 2017? <code>pthread</code> is for Linux POSIX threads and isn’t combined with Visual Studio, you can try to use NuGet packages or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=vs-2017">Vcpkg</a> to install and use pthread.</p> 
               <p>For NuGet packages, please launch Visual Studio 2017 and select your project &gt; <strong>right-click</strong> your project &gt; choose <strong>Manage NuGet Packages</strong>… &gt; Browse &gt; search and find <strong>pthreads</strong> &gt; Install.</p> 
               <p><img src="./fatal error C1083_ Cannot open include file_ &#39;pthread.h&#39;_ No such file or directory - Microsoft Q&amp;A_files/20338-screenshot3.png" alt="20338-screenshot3.png"></p> 
               <p>For Vcpkg, please refer to this document <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=vs-2017#installation">Installation(Vcpkg)</a></em>, and follow steps below to install Vcpkg.</p> 
               <ol> 
                <li><p> Go to <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg</a> &gt; clone the vcpkg repo and download it to any folder location that you prefer.</p> </li> 
                <li><p> Press <code>Windows key + R</code> to start <code>Run</code> and type <code>cmd</code> to open command prompt &gt; type <code>cd XXXX\XXXXX\...</code> to change to the directory where you used to save Vcpkg folder.</p> </li> 
                <li><p> Type <code>bootstrap-vcpkg.bat</code> (Windows) to install Vcpkg.</p> </li> 
                <li><p> Type <code>vcpkg.exe install pthread</code> to install pthread.</p> </li> 
               </ol> 
               <p><img src="./fatal error C1083_ Cannot open include file_ &#39;pthread.h&#39;_ No such file or directory - Microsoft Q&amp;A_files/20385-screenshot2.png" alt="20385-screenshot2.png"></p> 
               <ol> 
                <li><p> Run <code>vcpkg integrate install</code> to configure Visual Studio to locate all vcpkg header files and binaries on a per-user basis. You can refer to more details from here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=vs-2017#integrate-with-visual-studio-windows">Integrate with Visual Studio (Windows)</a>.</p> </li> 
                <li><p> If the <code>pthread.h</code> file still can’t be found by VS, you can try to include it manually, for example right-click your project &gt; Properties… &gt; Configuration Properties &gt; VC++ Directories &gt; Reference Directories &gt; Edit &gt; add a new line(path) which points to the folder that includes the pthread.h file (Maybe under this path C:\Users[user name]\AppData\Local\vcpkg\XXXX\XX\XXX\include\pthread.h).</p> </li> 
               </ol>
