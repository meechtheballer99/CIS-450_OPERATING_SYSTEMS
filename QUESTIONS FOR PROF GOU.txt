questions to ask Professor Gou:

*ask about dining phil. problem with monitors:
-when chopsticks are being used and a thread goes to wait state via the condition.wait() call, 
does it go to the condition variable waiting queue and also to the wait-state queue, or are those two one in the same?

*ask about this paragraph from the OS concepts book, chapter 6.6

It is important to admit that we have not completely eliminated busy
waiting with this definition of the wait() and signal() operations. Rather,
we have moved busy waiting from the entry section to the critical sections
of application programs. Furthermore, we have limited busy waiting to the
critical sections of the wait() and signal() operations, and these sections are
short (if properly coded, they should be no more than about ten instructions).
Thus, the critical section is almost never occupied, and busy waiting occurs

rarely, and then for only a short time. An entirely different situation exists
with application programs whose critical sections may be long (minutes or
even hours) or may almost always be occupied. In such cases, busy waiting
is extremely inefficient.
